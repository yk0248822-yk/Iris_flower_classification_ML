# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This project classifies Iris flowers into three categories:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

# Algorithm Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

# Libraries Used
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

# Steps Performed
- Loaded Iris dataset
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained KNN classifier
- Evaluated model using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Predicted class for new flower input

# Result
The model achieved high accuracy on the test dataset.
